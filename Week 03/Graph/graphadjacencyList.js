  // A visited set keeps track of visited nodes to avoid reprocessing nodes.
  // A stack is used to simulate the recursive DFS process, pushing nodes onto the stack
  // along with their parent nodes to check for back edges.

  // For Each Vertex:
  // The code iterates through all vertices in the graph (represented as this.adjacencyList).
  // For each unvisited vertex, a DFS search is initiated by pushing the current vertex and its
  // parent (which is null for the starting vertex) onto the stack.

  // DFS Loop:
  // The stack stores nodes along with their parent, ensuring that we do not mistake the
  // parent-child relationship as a cycle.
  // At each step of the loop, the current node is popped from the stack.
  // If the node has not been visited before, it's marked as visited.
  // Then, all neighbors of the current node are pushed onto the stack (with the current
  // node as their parent).

  // Cycle Detection:
  // For each neighbor of the current node:
  // If the neighbor is already visited and it's not the parent node (i.e., it's
  // not the node from which the current node was discovered), then a cycle is detected
  // because this means we’ve found a back edge.

  // If no cycle is found, the neighbor is pushed onto the stack with the
  // current node as its parent.

  // Return:
  // If a cycle is detected, the function returns true.

  // If no cycles are detected after processing all nodes,
  // it implicitly returns undefined (which means no cycle was found).

  // DFS Traversal: The algorithm performs a Depth-First Search to explore each node and its neighbors.
  // Parent Tracking: By keeping track of the parent of each node, the algorithm can differentiate
  // between a back edge (cycle) and a parent-child relationship.

  // Cycle Detection: A cycle is detected when a node’s neighbor has already been visited,
  // and that neighbor is not the parent of the current node. This indicates that the graph
  // contains a back edge, meaning there's a loop or cycle in the graph.

  // Time Complexity: O(V + E)
  // Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Each node and edge is
  // visited once during the DFS traversal.
